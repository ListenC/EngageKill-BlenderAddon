# Engage Kill Character Model Expression Repair Blender Addon

中文Readme请点击[这里](README.zh-CN.md)

## 1. Why

When exporting game models as FBX files, **facial expressions are not preserved**. The actual vertex offsets for expressions are exported as JSON files (`_bs_all.json` and `_bs_btl.json`) in the same directory as the model.  

This addon **adds expressions as shape keys** to the model using data from these JSON files.

## 2. How to Use

### 1) Addon Installation
- Place the addon folder in Blender's `\scripts\addons\` directory,  
  **OR**  
- Use `Edit > Preferences... > Add-ons > Install...` to select the ZIP file and enable the addon.

### 2) Addon Usage
#### **a. Import Character Model**  
Typically located in:  
`assets\veyron\external\assetbundleresources\character\model\chr\base\`

#### **b. Apply Expressions to Character**  

1. In the 3D Viewport, select:  
   `Object > Apply BlendShapes from JSON`  
   ![](./image/Step1_en.png)
2. Select the expression JSON file corresponding to the model  
 (Usually in the same directory as the model file):  
   ![](./image/Step2_en.png)  
3. Verify shape keys are properly added:  
   ![](./image/Step3_en.png)  

#### **c. Important Notes**  
  - **c.1** Adjust the `Global Scale Factor` during import if needed (default recommended).  
  - **c.2** Duplicate shape keys will be overwritten if re-imported.  
  - **c.3** Using JSON files from other models may cause errors due to vertex mismatches.  
  - **c.4** This addon is **exclusively for Engage Kill mobile game models**. Compatibility with other games is untested.  
  - **c.5** Languages Supported: `Simplified Chinese`, `Traditional Chinese`, `English`, `Japanese`
